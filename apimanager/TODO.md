# TODO List

TODO

* Sort out 'params' - at the moment, they're not common between Facebook and Instagram, but they could be with a bit of refactoring.
* Need to handle OAuth errors

DONE

* Refactor so that error checking / next action instructions are universal and can be shared between core functions
